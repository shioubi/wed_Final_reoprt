            <div class="question">Q1: How do I know if the payment transaction was successful?</div>
            <div class="answer">You can check by visiting the Taishin Bank Portal for Tuition Payment. If your payment status reads ‘Already Paid’, then you know the transaction was successful.<br/><a href="https://school.taishinbank.com.tw/" target="_blank">https://school.taishinbank.com.tw/</a></div>
          </div>
          <div class="qa">
            <div class="question">Q2: How long does it usually take for my payment status to be changed to ‘Already Paid’</div>
            <div class="answer">Every bank performs transactions on slightly different schedules. General timelines for payment methods are as follows:
               <br/>Credit card online: 3-10 days
               <br/>ATM or in person: 2-6 days
               <br/>Agricultural Bank of Taiwan: 4-7 days

          </div>
          <div class="qa">
            <div class="question">Q3: Why is it that I have already made two payments but my payment status hasn’t been changed to ‘Already Paid’?</div>

            <div class="question">Q6: Is there anything to be aware of if I pay online with a credit card?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              a. If you use a credit card to pay on an online platform, make sure that each step is done correctly.<br/>
              b. Make sure the credit card is valid and that the transaction was authorized. <br/>
              The following is the process that happens once you’ve paid:<br/>
              -> The transaction is authorized (you can check with the bank that issued your credit card to find out if the transaction was authorized)<br/>
              -> This information is sent to the payment platform<br/>
              -> From the platform, this information is sent to Taishin Bank (For questions, please call the Taishin service hotline: 0800-023-123)<br/>
              -> Taishin applies to the bank that issued your credit card for the tuition payment.<br/>
              -> After Taishin receives the payment, your payment status at the Taishin Bank Tuition and Fee Payment Portal will read ‘Already Paid’<br/>
              -> You can pay off your credit card<br/>
              c. After paying, go to the Taishin Bank Tuition and Fees Payment Portal to make sure your payment status is correct. If there are any errors, please check that the transaction was authorized by your credit card provider, or contact our service hotline to see if the transaction was successful. If it wasn’t, you will have to repeat the payment process.<br/>
              <br/>
              <span style="color:white; background-color: purple">If there are any errors, please check that the transaction was authorized by your credit card provider, or contact our service hotline to see if the transaction was successful.
